Tourist Guide: Move around the tourists while using minimum resources. (My Discrete Structures' Final Project)

The task of the tourist guide is to move around the tourists while using minimum resources. In this problem a tourist guide needs to take some tourists from one city to another. The cities are inter connected with a road network. For each pair of neighboring cities there is a bus service that runs only between those two cities and uses the road that directly connects them. Each bus service has a limit on the maximum number of passengers it can carry. He cannot drop any passenger in the midway. Due to this, the tourist guide knows that some cities would require making extra trips if the number of tourists are more than seating capacity. For example, consider the following road map of 7 cities shown in figure given below. The edges connecting the cities represent the roads and the number written on each edge indicates the passenger limit of the bus service that runs on that road.

For Example:
To take 99 tourists from city 1 to city 7, he will require at least 4 trips, and the route he would take is: 1 - 2 - 4 - 7.

It only works in linux terminal for now because of system functions and will be updated soon.
